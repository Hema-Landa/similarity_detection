This project aims for automatic descriptive grading which compares the student’s answer to the original or reference template. We have done the evaluation based on the “most important words” the documents and their related corpus contain.
For this example, the code has compared the answers wrt first answer and we have printed the corresponding similarity percentages.
We all know that health is wealth. With its intricate network of bones, muscles, and organs, a well-functioning human body is much like an orchestrated symphony. To keep this orchestra playing well, we need physical exercise. It may take the form of sports, yoga, or even regular walking. It is well-known that people who engage in physical exercise stay happier and live longer. Our society is turning towards more and more technical sophistication and automation. The machine has replaced our physical labor. To compensate for this change in lifestyle we need physical exercise. Exercise also sharpens our intellect. It keeps a balance between our body and mind. With the help of regular physical training, we will stay healthier, happier, and more alert. ',
